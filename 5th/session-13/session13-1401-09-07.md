## Why we define preprocessor ?
       allows us to use features such as variables , nestings , modules , that don't 
       exist in css.
       the sass compiled , converted to css at the end 

## module bundlers 
       in react we use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a module bundler 
   
### how can we configuration webpack in our project ?
       set some loaders (sass , etc loaders) to our webpack 
       [configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/)

   
## task runners 
       [npm scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
   
## what are differences between task runners a module bundlers  ?
    As the name implies,Â **task runner** automatically execute processes behind the 
    scenes, saving both work and time, while **module bundlers** combine various  
    filesthat can be executed together. Both are practical front-end  development 
    tools that optimize performance by taking care of simple and repetitive 
    processes.
